 * The strcpy() function copies the bytes from the string pointed to by src to 
 * the buffer pointed to by dst (including the terminating '\0' character) and 
 * returns dest. It is easily misused with the buffer overflow issue. When 
 * calling strcpy(), the programmer must take care that the bytes being copied 
 * donÂ´t overrun the space available in the buffer pointed to by dst. The 
 * strncpy() function fixes this problem, because it receives an extra 
 * argument when called. That argument is n, and it refers to the size of the 
 * string pointed to by src. At most, it copies n bytes from src to dst. As 
 * long as n does not exceed the space allocated in dst, a buffer overrun can 
 * never occur.
